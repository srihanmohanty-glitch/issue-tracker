## 2. Codebase Structure & Best Practices

- **TypeScript Usage:**  
  Interfaces and types are defined for user data, improving type safety.
- **React Components:**  
  Components like `AccountManager.tsx` use optional chaining and fallback values to prevent runtime errors.
- **API Layer:**  
  API calls are abstracted in a service layer, which is a good practice.
- **Error Handling:**  
  Error states are handled in components, with user feedback for failed API calls.
- **Security:**  
  JWT authentication and role-based access are implemented.
- **Documentation:**  
  Resolved issues and instructions are well documented in `Copilotdata-saves/README.md`.

## 3. Potential Improvements

- **Testing:**  
  Add more unit and integration tests for critical components and backend endpoints.
- **API Validation:**  
  Ensure backend always returns consistent data structures matching frontend expectations.
- **Error Logging:**  
  Both frontend and backend should log errors for easier debugging.
- **Commit Hygiene:**  
  Continue making clear, atomic commits after each significant change or fix.
