## Resolved Issues

### 1. Blank Screen on `/accounts` Route

**Issue:**  
Navigating to `/accounts` resulted in a blank screen. Console showed:  
`TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'department')`

**Resolution:**  
- Updated the user rendering code to use optional chaining and a fallback value:
  ```tsx
  {user?.profile?.department ?? 'N/A'}
  ```
- This prevents runtime errors if `profile` or `department` is missing from the user object.

**How to achieve it:**  
- In `src/components/AccountManager.tsx`, ensure all references to `department` use optional chaining and a fallback.
- Example:
  ```tsx
  <td>{user?.profile?.department ?? 'N/A'}</td>
  ```

**Next step:**  
Commit these changes to git with a message like:  
`fix: prevent crash on /accounts when department is missing`
